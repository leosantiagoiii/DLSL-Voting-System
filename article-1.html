						&emsp;The College of Information Technology and Engineering (CITE), for the past 5 years has had a number of near misses to rule the Lasallian  Cup.  After a long streak in attempt of claiming victory, they remain unwavering in their efforts to claim the title as champions.<br><br>
						&emsp;<q style="font-weight: bold;">We are dedicated to get the cup</q> - Governor, CITE<br><br>
						&emsp;<q>In SG CITE, we’re doing all the ways and processes so that during LS Cup, CITE is not just prepared for the fight, but ready to claim the LS Cup,</q> Chris Warren Manalo, CITE governor said.<br><br>
						&emsp;He also said that they took extra effort in selling  CITE shirts, and that the collected funds were used for the betterment the athletes’ performances during the games.
						Manalo also addressed the issue that CITE has not claimed the championship for years. <q>Maybe God has [a] plan, maybe it’s not our time in the past [years],</q> said Manalo.<br><br>
						However, he suggested that players for this year are more dedicated in their training and preparation. <q>I know that CITEzens will not just [be] stronger. We are dedicated to get the cup… On what I have observed with our sports contact person, they were willing to have training and practices so that they are prepared enough.</q><br><br>
						&emsp;<q style="font-weight: bold;">We want to give CITE our first ever win</q> - Captain,  Cheerdance<br><br>
						Despite the various comments their Bollywood-themed performance received last year, CITE Cheerdance Captain, Jefferson Hernandez,  assured that they are nothing but fiercer this year.  <q>This year lalaban kami for gold, we want to make history and give CITE our first ever win.</q><br><br>
						&emsp;Last year, CITE failed to secure the gold in Men’s Basketball despite dominating it for the previous years. Their coach, Reymel Encinas, said that conflicts arose last year leading to their loss. <q>Nagkaroon ng konting hindi pagkakaintindihan sa mga players kaya nagkaganoon yung sistema.</q><br><br>
						&emsp;As Mr. and Ms. Lasallian Cup has grown quite competitive through the years, CITE’s bets for this season, Elisea Mantuano and Juni Alec Bañaga, both BS Industrial Engineering students,  did not back down on their preparations to secure a win.<br><br>
						&emsp;<q style="font-weight: bold;">Siyempre meron [kaming] pageant workshops,  rehearsals, personality development training para pagdating ng LS Cup, okay yung mga presentation sa mga candidates,</q> Mantuano shared.
						She also added that since the candidate for Ms. CITE bagged the medal as Ms. LS Cup last year, it adds pressure on her.
						Meanwhile Bañaga said that for him, there is no stress in the competition. “Wala naman [pressure]... kasi friendly competition naman para sakin.”<br><br>

						<br>
						&emsp;CITE, through the years, have proven themselves as fighters despite near misses of claiming victory. This season, CITE will surely not hold back in claiming the crown, and rise as red as the dawn.
